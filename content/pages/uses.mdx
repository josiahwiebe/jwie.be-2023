Occassionally somebody will ask me "what **\_** do you use". This is the page I point them to. It also helps me look back and see how my tools have evolved.

## Hardware & Desk

- 💻 [MacBook Pro 15-inch (2016)](https://www.apple.com/ca/macbook-pro/) - I don't have much use for the Touch Bar, and the keyboard is plagued by issues, but it's hooked up to a display most of the time.
- 🍑 [Herman Miller Aeron Chair](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/) - This is my chair. There are many like it but this one is mine.
- 👨🏼‍💻 [Herman Miller Renew Sit-to-Stand Desk](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/tables/sit-to-stand-tables/renew-sit-to-stand-tables/product-details/) - I have this one in walnut. Standing is a good idea when you remember to do it.
- 🖥 [LG Ultrafine 27-inch 5K Display](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HKN62LL/A/lg-ultrafine-5k-display) - Not a bad display, but not super great looking. Next one will probably the 34-inch Ultrawide.
- 💧 [Rain Design mStand](https://www.raindesigninc.com/mstand.html) - A perfect perch for my MacBook.

## Software

- ⌨️ [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/yp)
- ⚡️ [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) - My favourite terminal, with some plugins. I use ZSH.
- 🎡 [Local](https://localbyflywheel.com/) - If I'm working on a Wordpress site, I use Local to run it... locally.
- 😴 [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) (also [Paw](https://paw.cloud/)) - For HTTP requests. I'm in the midst of evaluating Insomnia as I've been using Paw for some time.
- 🔢 [Numi](https://numi.io/) - A running feed of my calculator. Probably one of my favourite apps.
- 🔑 [1Password](https://1password.com/) - Keeping me sane amongst all these generated passwords. Also manages 2FA for everything.
- 🧲 [Magnet](http://magnet.crowdcafe.com/) - I love using Magnet for window management.
- 🌎 [NordVPN](https://www.tripmode.ch/) - My VPN of choice. Invaluable in airports and coffee shops.
