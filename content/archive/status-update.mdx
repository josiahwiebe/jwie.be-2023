This is a follow-up post to my earlier post; [Choosing a Web-Presence](http://jwie.be/choosing-blog-format).

Firstly, I'd like to apologise for my lack of keeping up-to-date. It's not like I haven't been writing; [Josh](http://thenewsprint.co) got me into Field Notes, but it's primarily been for [Collectif](http://collectif.co) or for [trip planning](http://thewieb.es).

I've chosen a web-presence! In the near future, I'll be saying good-bye to Svbtle as my primary blog and moving all of my online presence over to a site built using Siteleaf (the domain will still be [jwie.be](http://jwie.be)).

[Jon](http://jondueck.ca) and I have been using [Siteleaf](http://siteleaf.net) over at [Collectif](http://collectif.co) for quite some time now, and we _love_ developing with it.

The site is coming along fairly well, I'm really focusing on the typography and simplicity of the site. Here's a screenshot of the style-guide for your viewing pleasure.[![Screen Shot 2014-04-25 at 9.09.08 .png](https://svbtleusercontent.com/4bl146zab5mqua_small.png)](https://svbtleusercontent.com/4bl146zab5mqua.png)

I hope to launch the new site in mid-May, but it will depend on whether my upcoming trip plans interfere with that or not.

If you'd like to keep up-to-date, you might find me over on Twitter as [@josiahwiebe](https://twitter.com/josiahwiebe), where I may post the occasional update.

Thanks for stopping by!
