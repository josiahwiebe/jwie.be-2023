title: Launch Center Pro & Daily Journaling

**Update**: Launch Center Pro was updated to version 2.3 with all kinds of amazing features! Read more about it [here](/archive/launch-center-pro-updated)

I was recently reading about [meal logging](https://thenewsprint.co/blog/launch-center-pro-action-to-log-meals/) with [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) & [Launch Center Pro](https://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/) on [The Newsprint](https://thenewsprint.co). I’m not very disciplined at digital journaling, and [Josh](https://twitter.com/joshuaginter) got me thinking. I began to devise a few of my own actions, generally based around menial events that had a daily significance.

Most of these actions are based around things that I’ve enjoyed throughout the day– a good glass of wine, a favourite beer, a perfect coffee or a great book. In fact, I compiled so many actions that I created a dedicated group in Launch Center Pro; Input. Here’s what it looks like right now:

It’s far easier for me to keep on top of documenting these very tangible things throughout my day. My Daily Summary action has a very important “Physical Notebook Reference” field at the end. This is because I still primarily write my thoughts down on physical paper, usually in [Field Notes](http://fieldnotesbrand.com) Brand notebooks or [Moleskine Cahiers](http://shop.moleskine.com/en-us/notebooks-journals/cahier/). This field allows me to easily make reference to which notebook I’ve written in that day (thanks to Josh for giving me this idea).

The list so far:

- [Daily Summary](http://launchcenterpro.com/5gc7mm) - intended to give a brief summary of my day. I’ll refine it a bit more, perhaps to abandon the table format.
- [Book Log](http://launchcenterpro.com/k9k19d) - via The Newsprint
- [Meal Log](http://launchcenterpro.com/4nszwt) - via The Newsprint
- [Cocktails Log](http://launchcenterpro.com/jpbqrv)
- [Film Log](http://launchcenterpro.com/4k5z63) - a movie entry action
- [Wine Log](http://launchcenterpro.com/hs5rtm)
- [Beer Log](http://launchcenterpro.com/90gtdq) - via [Jeff Mueller](http://jeffmueller.net/post/77956163976/beer-journaling-with-day-one-and-launch-center-pro)
- [Coffee Log](http://launchcenterpro.com/hpn81v) - adapted from [Ben Tsai](http://bentsai.wordpress.com/2014/02/26/day-one-templates-using-launch-center-pro/)’s coffee log

Edit:

Upon Josh’s request, I’ve added a [Sleep Log](http://launchcenterpro.com/m6yyt9).
