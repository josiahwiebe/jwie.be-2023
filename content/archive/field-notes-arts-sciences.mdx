I can’t say I’ve been more excited for a pack of notebooks. That grid is going to be beautiful. The colour choices are lovely as well.

I’ve always loved the dot-grid for my sketches, but I think that the blank page will be good for me. I often have little sketches or diagrams that accompany my notes, and it will be interesting to try not having them inline with the actual notes.

My only gripes are the ruled pages and size choice. I find the ruling to be too large for my tiny scrawlings. I’ve always thought it odd that they didn’t choose the standard B7 for their notebooks (standard passport size); it seems that trying a new size would be a good opportunity to go to a standard.

In any case, I’ll be eagerly awaiting my Arts & Sciences pack (whilst trying to fill my existing Colors editions).
