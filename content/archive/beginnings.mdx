I’ve been working with the web for a long time.

My earliest memories of “creating websites” began in the year 2004. I was an avid [Redwall](http://redwallabbey.com) fan and had just started learning about the web. I believe I started with Geocities, where there was an avid Redwall community springing up. I decided to start a “fact” website. There was a great deal of fan-fiction sites springing up, as well as countless numbers of phpBB forums. What I thought the community really needed was a wiki type site that would allow fans to find information about any Redwall character. This was before the actual Redwall [wiki](http://redwall.wikia.com) was started, and it was fairly well received by the community. I continued to move from technology to technology, always trying something new. I learned HTML, CSS, PHP, basic JavaScript and so on. My first non-GeoCities site used frames (yikes!), and then I moved to CSS divs (that was amazing). I tried out WYSIWYG editors, including RapidWeaver, iWeb etc. I probably spent almost every waking moment on this project, called “Redfacts.” That’s fascinating, because I can hardly find a trace of it anywhere these days. Most of the sites I frequented every day have all long since been removed from their servers. I don’t think I even have any archived versions of my site.

It’s amazing how the web has changed since then. We’ve seen the death of frames, Flash, and so on. It’s been a grand adventure so far, and I cannot wait to see what will happen next.

I’ll always be grateful for Redwall for igniting the creativity in me and spurring me to create websites.
