Today is my last day as a web designer at [Co-op@Home](http://www.coopathome.ca).

I’ve been working for this business for quite a while.

It started in 2008; I was in high-school and was ~~interested~~ obsessed with the workings of computers. I started part time at Something Digital, where I worked a junior technician. My dad, [Tim](https://twitter.com/timwiebe), had just left the business to go back to teaching, and I got to work with a number of amazing people (some of whom are still working at Co-op@Home). Things seemed to spiral up from there.

A number of positions and several years later, I’m finishing with a bang as their web & graphic designer. It’s been an amazing couple of years and it pains me to leave such an amazing team, but I’m eagerly anticipating some of the opportunities to come.

I’m excited to join the team at [Pixels](http://pixelsinc.ca/) this coming Monday as the Creative Director.

A special thanks to everybody who helped make my time with Co-op an amazing time!
