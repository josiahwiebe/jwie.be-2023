I’ve been negligent in writing here, as well as keeping you informed about what’s happening in my life right now.

I’m sure most of my semi-regular readers have already abandoned me, but I thought I’d give a quick update here anyway.

My wife and I are currently living in Hawaii, volunteering at the YWAM base here. During this time, I won’t really be writing about much here. I’ll be continuing to work on [Collectif](https://collectif.co) projects during my time here. We do have some availability at the moment, so get in touch if you’re interested.

I’m keeping family and friends updated on our time here over at our [family website](https://thewiebes.ca), so feel free to follow along if you please.

Mahalo for now!
