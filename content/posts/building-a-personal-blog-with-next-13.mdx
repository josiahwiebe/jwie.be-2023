In the last number of years, I'd completely come to rely on using Twitter as a way to "put things out into the world", as well as keep up to date with what's going on in the world.

The sale of Twitter had folks thinking about "owning their own platform" and I was no different. In late 2022, I decided to re-vitalize my website by building my own personal feed. Next.js 13 had just launched with the new `appDir` beta, and I thought it would be a a great opportunity to test out some new tools.

## The Stack

- [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13) (using `appDir` beta)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [Next-Auth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/)

- Vercel

## The Process

### Step 1: Setup Next.js 13

My personal website was already built using Next.js, so the first step was to upgrade to Next.js 13. I followed the [upgrade guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/upgrading) and everything went smoothly. They allow you to move to the new `appDir` beta incrementally by adding a `next.config.js` file to the root of your project.

```js
module.exports = {
  experimental: {
    appDir: true,
  },
}
```

With that configured, I could start to move my `pages` directory into the `app` directory. I would also start converting my components to React Server Components.

I was previously using the `@next/mdx` package for MDX support, but I wanted some additional flexibility to be able to work with MDX in a more dynamic way. I also wanted to be able to use traditional Markdown style front-matter. I decided to use [`next-mdx-remote`](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) instead.
